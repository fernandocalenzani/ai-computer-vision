## Overview

This repository is dedicated to my studies in computer vision, a fascinating field that focuses on teaching machines to interpret and understand visual data. In this project, I'll be exploring various important topics related to computer vision.

## Important Topics

Here are some of the key topics I will be covering during this study project:

- Image Processing
- Object Detection
- Image Classification
- Feature Extraction
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- OpenCV
- Deep Learning for Computer Vision

### Face Detection

1. Haarcascade and OpenCV
2. Eyes, Face, People and Clock
3. HOG and Dlib
4. Face detection using CNN using Dlib
5. Face detection using webcam
